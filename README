2DVCE (2D Virtual Creature Evolution) is an attempt to recreate "Evolution Simulator" by Cary Huang
in C++, with the help of SFML.

Special thanks to:
- Cary Huang (carykh) for his awesome Evolution Simulator, written in Processing that inspired me to make this.
- Lee Graham for 3DVCE, which was abandoned, but still has a catchy name (which I stole).
- The SFML Team for making such an awesome multimedia library.

Notes:
Currently, it's only for linux. Sorrrryyyyy.

2DVCE isn't finished yet. But just you wait!
